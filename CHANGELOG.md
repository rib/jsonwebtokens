## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Allow PEM certificates to be read as public keys ([#19](https://github.com/rib/jsonwebtokens/pull/19))

### Changed

- A verifier with no associated `kid` will allow any token `kid` (like a wildcard) instead of requiring there to be no `kid`. This is a fix that's consistent with the original API documentation ([#18](https://github.com/rib/jsonwebtokens/pull/18))


## [1.1.0] 2021-08-15

### Added

- Allow string _or_ array `aud` claims (previously just allowed string `aud`) ([#13](https://github.com/rib/jsonwebtokens/issues/13))

### Removed

- Spurious assertion that any empty claim key `""` must have a string value
